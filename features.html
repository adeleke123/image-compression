        <h3>Lossless Compression</h3>
        <p>
          Our algorithm uses lossless compression to reduce the size of
          your images without losing any information. This ensures that
          your images look great while taking up less space on your
          website.

        <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
        <p>
          You can upload multiple images at once and our algorithm will
          compress them all in one go. This saves you time and effort,
          and makes it easy to compress large numbers of images at once.

        <h3>Customizable Settings</h3>
        <p>
          Our algorithm lets you customize the compression settings to
          suit your needs. You can choose the level of compression to apply, 
          adjust the image dimensions, and choose between different image formats such as JPEG, PNG, 
          and WebP. This flexibility allows you to strike a balance between image quality and file size,
          so you can achieve the best possible results for your specific use case.
