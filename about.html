        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Our image compression algorithm was inspired by the need for faster,
          more efficient ways to process and store large amounts of visual data.
          As photographers ourselves, we saw firsthand how much time and effort
          goes into optimizing images for different platforms and devices. We
          wanted to create a solution that could automate this process and make
          it accessible to anyone.

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <h3>Lossless Compression</h3>
          <p>
            Our algorithm uses lossless compression techniques to maintain the
            original image quality while reducing the file size. This ensures that
            images look just as good as the original, but take up less space on your
            device or server.
          </p>
          <h3>Customizable Settings</h3>
          <p>
            Our compression algorithm allows you to customize the compression settings
            to fit your needs. You can adjust the compression ratio, resize images, and
            choose from a variety of file formats to optimize your images for different
            platforms and devices.
          </p>
          <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Our batch processing feature allows you to compress multiple images at
            once, saving you time and effort. You can upload entire folders of images
            and have them compressed automatically according to your specified
            settings.
          </p>
          <h3>Cloud Integration</h3>
          <p>
            Our algorithm can be integrated with cloud storage platforms like Amazon
            S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure. This allows you to compress
            images as they are uploaded to the cloud, reducing storage costs and
            improving access times.
